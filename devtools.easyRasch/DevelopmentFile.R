#This development file contains all of the code and documentation for said code for the package. You will NOT find documentation in the individual R files so that this can be a one stop shop for grading.
#That being said, the R files contain the necessary Roxygen code in order to generate functioning (hopefully with the correct functionality) functions and helpful help files.
